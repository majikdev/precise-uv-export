## Precise UV Export

This is an add-on I made for Blender, which lets you export a pixel-perfect UV layout to an image.

## Installing

To use it, download the latest release and install the `precise_uv_export.py` file in Blender's add-ons preferences; then enable it. **NOTE:** This addon works with Blender 3.0.0 or above.

## Usage

When in the UV Editor view, press the UV drop-down menu and press Export Precise Layout.

When exporting, it is possible to choose the image's size, which defaults to the size of the image currently shown in the UV Editor, or 16x16 pixels if there is none.
