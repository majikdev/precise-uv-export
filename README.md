## Precise UV Export

This is an add-on I made for Blender, which lets you export a pixel-perfect UV layout to an image.

## Installing

To use it, download the latest release (or just clone/download the repository) and install the `precise_uv_export.py` file through Blender's add-ons preferences; then enable it.

**NOTE:** This addon works with Blender 3.0.0 or above.

## Usage

When in the UV Editor view, press the `UV` drop-down menu and press `Export Precise Layout`.

When exporting, it is possible to choose the image's size, which defaults to the size of the image currently in the UV Editor, or 16 by 16 pixels if there is none.
